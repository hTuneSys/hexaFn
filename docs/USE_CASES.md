# USE_CASES.md

This document outlines the main use cases that the hexaFn project is designed to solve, along with example scenarios and benefits for developers and users.

---

## 🎯 Primary Purpose

hexaFn aims to be a modular, testable, and open-source functional utility toolkit that improves code reliability, clarity, and expressiveness in Rust projects.

---

## 🧰 Use Case 1: Functional Helpers

### Problem

Rust lacks built-in higher-order utility functions that are ergonomic.

### Solution

hexaFn provides reusable functional patterns (e.g., `pipe`, `compose`, `tap`, `curry`) that help with chaining and composing functions without complex boilerplate.

---

## ⚙️ Use Case 2: Clean Pipelines for Data Transformation

### Problem (Use Case 2)

Data transformation pipelines become verbose or hard to debug.

### Solution (Use Case 2)

hexaFn enables declarative data manipulation using readable pipeline-style syntax, reducing nesting and cognitive load.

---

## 🧪 Use Case 3: Safer Expression Handling

### Problem (Use Case 3)

Chaining operations with side-effects or unwraps can introduce runtime errors.

### Solution (Use Case 3)

The library wraps side-effects and provides safer alternatives to map/and_then chains using controlled context-aware execution utilities.

---

## 🔄 Use Case 4: Testable and Predictable Function Chains

### Problem (Use Case 4)

Inconsistent or untestable chains of closures across codebases.

### Solution (Use Case 4)

With structured chaining, currying, and composability, test coverage becomes easier and logic becomes clearer.

---

## 🧩 Use Case 5: Compose-like Behavior in Microservices

### Problem (Use Case 5)

Repeated logic across microservice layers without reuse.

### Solution (Use Case 5)

hexaFn enables logic reuse by composing independent, pure functions that can be injected or reused across service layers.

---

## 👤 Use Case 6: Empowering Beginners in Functional Rust

### Problem (Use Case 6)

New developers struggle with Rust’s functional programming style.

### Solution (Use Case 6)

By introducing intuitive utilities and documentation, hexaFn helps onboard contributors and learners with clean patterns and understandable utilities.

---

These use cases represent practical examples of how hexaFn enhances productivity and reliability in modern Rust applications.
