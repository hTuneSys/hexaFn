# MILESTONES.md

This document defines the structured milestone plan for the hexaFn project. Each milestone spans three development sprints, focusing on a specific theme or functional domain. The plan aims to support clarity, maintainability, and sustainable progress over time.

---

## Milestone 1: Establish Trigger → Run flow using DSL  

Introduce the core trigger and execution pipeline. The goal is to allow events to trigger function execution using a domain-specific language (DSL). This milestone sets up the project structure and implements a basic trigger system and DSL interpreter, enabling an end-to-end flow where a defined trigger condition executes a DSL-based function.

---

## Milestone 2: Webhook integration and event broadcasting  

Enable external events to enter the system and be disseminated internally. This milestone focuses on creating a webhook endpoint to receive events and a publish/subscribe mechanism to broadcast those events. It establishes secure ingestion of HTTP webhook calls, normalizes incoming data into a standard event format, and distributes events to various components via an in-memory bus (Cast).

---

## Milestone 3: Observability, logging, and event tracing  

Build a robust observability layer across the pipeline. The aim is to introduce structured logging and tracing so that every event, trigger evaluation, and function execution can be monitored. This milestone implements a trace ID propagation model, enriched logging with context, and metrics endpoints, allowing developers to trace events end-to-end and gather performance insights in real time.

---

## Milestone 4: KV storage and configuration persistence  

Provide persistent configuration storage through a key-value store interface. This milestone introduces a KV storage module to save and retrieve configuration (like trigger definitions or function settings) reliably. It starts with an in-memory store and evolves to a file-based (and potential external) storage, supporting features like namespacing, versioning, data validation, and hot-reloading of configuration at runtime.

---

## Milestone 5: Runtime support for WASM/JS/Lua execution  

Extend function execution beyond the DSL by supporting multiple runtimes. The goal of this milestone is to implement a unified FunctionRuntime interface and integrate WebAssembly (WASM), JavaScript, and Lua execution engines alongside the existing DSL. It ensures that functions can be written in different languages, with proper sandboxing and resource limits, while maintaining a consistent API, metrics tracking, and error handling across all runtime types.

---

## Milestone 6: Output forwarding and external delivery  

Allow function results to be delivered to external systems or outputs. This milestone defines an output forwarding framework and implements various output channels (such as HTTP callbacks, Kafka topics, WebSocket streams, or file sinks). The focus is on configuring where and how function outcomes are sent, including support for batching, retries, and result filtering, along with thorough logging of delivery attempts for audit and reliability.
