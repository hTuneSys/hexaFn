We welcome pull requests, feature proposals, documentation improvements, and plugin contributions.

---

## üìå How to Contribute

### 1. üß† Understand the Vision
hexaFn is a modular, programmable event engine built on the **6F Lifecycle Flow**:  
**Feed ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Format ‚Üí Function ‚Üí Forward ‚Üí Feedback**

Before contributing, please read our [README](./README.md) to get familiar with the architecture and core modules.

---

### 2. üõ† Code Contributions

- Fork this repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/my-feature`)
- Make your changes with clear commits
- Run available tests (`cargo test`, etc.)
- Submit a pull request with a clear title and description

> Contributions that include tests and documentation will be prioritized.

---

### 3. üß© Plugin Contributions

We love modularity!  
If you're building a plugin (custom function, middleware, or bridge):

- Place it in `plugins/` or `extensions/` with a clear directory name
- Add a README in your plugin folder
- Explain:
  - What it does
  - What inputs it expects
  - Any dependencies or usage examples

---

### 4. üìù Documentation Contributions

Found a typo, unclear part, or missing explanation?  
Feel free to:

- Suggest edits to the README
- Add a markdown doc under `/docs/`
- Improve code comments in Rust or DSL functions

---

### 5. ü§ù Code Style & Commit Guidelines

- Use `snake_case` for file names and `camelCase` or `PascalCase` for types/functions as per Rust standards
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages:
  - ‚úÖ `feat: add trigger chaining logic`
  - ‚úÖ `fix: handle null in input formatter`
- Keep PRs focused and small (1 feature or fix per PR)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Branch & Merge Policy

- Never push directly to `main`
- All changes must go through pull requests (PR)
- PRs require approval by project owners before merge
- Merge method: **squash and merge** preferred

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Branch Naming Convention

Use the following pattern:
```
<type>/<module>/<short-description>
```
**Examples:**
- `feat/run/wasm-runtime`
- `fix/store/null-check`

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `style` 

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pull Request Guidelines

- Use the provided PR template
- Include related issue (e.g. `Closes #42`)
- Check off affected modules and checklist
- Ensure `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, and `clippy` pass before submitting

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Issue Guidelines

- Use the `bug report` or `feature request` templates
- Include logs, screenshots, or reproduction steps when possible

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Commit Message Format (Semantic Release)

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automate versioning and changelogs.

| Prefix | Meaning            | Version Impact     |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| feat:  | Add a new feature  | minor version bump |
| fix:   | Fix a bug          | patch version bump |
| perf:  | Performance change | patch version bump |
| docs:  | Docs only          | no version change  |
| chore: | Build/config/meta  | no version change  |
| BREAKING CHANGE: | In footer | major version bump üî• |

### **Examples:**

#### ‚ûï Add a New Feature (minor)
```
feat(run): support WASM sandbox execution
```

#### üêõ Fix a Bug (patch)
```
fix(store): resolve panic when key is empty
```

#### üìà Improve Performance (patch)
```
perf(trigger): reduce evaluation loop overhead
```

#### üìö Documentation Only (no bump)
```
docs: clarify HexaBridge usage in README
```

#### üîß Tooling Change (no bump)
```
chore(ci): switch to GitHub Actions for build
```

#### üí• Breaking Change (major)
```
feat(store): introduce versioned keys

BREAKING CHANGE: old keys will no longer be recognized by the runtime.
```
